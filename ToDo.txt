- Use this as locale_id in DB (this is the only variable that return integer!!):
$this -> fc -> settings -> locale -> available -> lang -> _1 -> default

- Insert all redundant data in object_* into object and object_info
like columns(comments/options/published/approved/meta_data/...) in object_photo

- In the Packages/Object/Controller/PhotoAdmin (add/edit)
* Undefined property: BootStrap::$_dateTodayVeryShortDate
* Call to undefined method Object_Model_Photo::GetAllCleanPhotosOrderByColWithLimit()

- publish_from/publish_to when adding object and the admin insert blank should be handled when editing the object.

- add condition in order update query in insert/update table, handle if the admin didn't type prder !
- the update quesry by default +2 the value not +

- Check if we need to keep "import/export" in Aula_Controller_Action or change it tobe plugin?
